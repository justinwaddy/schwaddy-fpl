# schwaddy-fpl

Automated FPL **Draft** decision engine. Projections via low-rank matrix
completion (Athey et al. 2021) on the player-gameweek panel; decisions
(draft board, weekly XI, waivers, trades) chosen to maximise P(win) in a
6-team draft league with aggregate (classic) scoring. Dashboard served as
static JSON + HTML to justinwaddy.co.uk.

## Layout
- src/schwaddy/api.py         draft + classic API clients (public reads, no auth)
- src/schwaddy/draft_board.py v0 heuristic projections + VORP (21 Aug 2026 draft)
- src/schwaddy/mc.py          TROP-forecast estimator (port of justinwaddy/TROP v0.2.8, tau dropped, season+GW-of-season time effects, AR(1) factor extension into the forecast block)
- src/schwaddy/panel.py       five-season player-gameweek panel under draft scoring
- src/schwaddy/lineup.py      weekly XI + waiver optimiser (sessions 2-3)
- src/schwaddy/news.py        league news feed written to data/news.json
- .github/workflows/update.yml cron: 09:35 UK full refresh, 19:45 + 23:20 UK matchday news
- site/                       dashboard HTML; draft_room.html is the live draft tool

## News feed
The morning cron does the full refit and picks up overnight flag changes,
processed waivers and trades, and the official end-of-gameweek recap. The
two evening crons run `refresh --news-only`, which skips the refit and posts
the matchday recap once the day's matches have wrapped up - 19:45 UK covers
the 12:30, 15:00 and 17:30 kick-offs, 23:20 UK covers the 20:00 slot: the live table, who
moved in it, a projected finish from the morning run's forecasts, and whose
players are still to come. Both append to data/news.json, which the News tab
reads directly. Everything is diffed against the previous run's state, so an
event fires once and re-running is a no-op.

## Lambda selection (backtest-informed)
CV is under the decision loss (realized XI points on placebo blocks), not
RMSE - see mc.TropForecast.cv_utility. Horizons differ: weekly XI and
waiver decisions use the utility-CV lambda_time (0.03 on 25/26 evidence);
season-ahead draft boards should use flatter recency (0.01), since heavy
discounting overweights end-of-season form at 38-GW horizons. Validated in
backtest.py (52.1 XI pts/GW vs 45.9 best benchmark) and draftsim.py
(22/30 simulated league titles, +171 pts vs best benchmark, t=7.1).

## Odds covariates (tested, off by default)
odds.py loads five seasons of Bet365 closing odds (football-data.co.uk,
100% name-match) and a the-odds-api.com live client (ODDS_API_KEY secret).
Backtested on 25/26: de-vigged 1X2 + over-2.5 covariates IMPROVE global
RMSE slightly but COST ~2 XI pts/GW (49.9 vs 52.1); interacting odds with
a premium-player indicator recovers to 51.5, still below no-odds. Fixture
sensitivity is heterogeneous in player quality, and team-level odds are
largely spanned by home + opponent-conceded at the top of the ranking, so
panel.build(use_odds=False) is the validated default. The genuinely
informative odds upgrade would be PLAYER-level markets (anytime scorer),
which lack a free historical source.

## Availability findings (tested, nothing shipped)
Empirical return ramp from 5 seasons of masked spells (absence >= 3 GWs):
mean points ratio to own baseline is 0.82 in the first match back and ~1.0
from the second match on. A first-match-back 0.82 discount changed ZERO of
38 backtest XIs: trailing-8 P(play) already excludes returning players at
the selection boundary, so the ramp is redundant with the availability
layer. The reverse fix (faster recency weighting, 3-GW window blended in)
is significantly WORSE (49.2 vs 52.0 XI pts/GW, t=-2.25): short windows
overreact to one-week rotation. Trailing-8 + API status flags stands.

## Validation across two seasons
Identical protocol, two held-out targets: 25/26 XI 53.6/GW vs 47.2 best
benchmark (+6.4); 24/25 XI 61.7/GW vs 54.1 (+7.6), with better RMSE and
rank correlation there too. The decision edge replicates out of sample.
Run: python -m schwaddy.backtest . 3  (season index, 4 = 25/26 default).

## Endgame and trades (modules, need league id + rival squads)
endgame.py: mean-variance XI search with Monte Carlo P(win). Measured
finding: XI-level variance tilting is worth ~nothing in draft (P(win)
flat in kappa, best ~0 whether trailing or leading by 40 with 9 GWs
left) because the squad is fixed and tilts swap only marginal players.
Rank-awareness should instead act through WAIVER/trade targets (acquire
high-sd players when trailing) - future extension, hook exists.
trades.py: model value vs consensus value (shrunk PPG x remaining);
suggest_trades finds offers that look fair on consensus but favour you
on model value.

## Pipeline (target state)
1. Pull draft bootstrap, league details, element-status (waiver pool), fixtures.
2. Rebuild the player-gameweek panel (5 seasons vaastav archive + live season).
3. Matrix completion projections under draft scoring; availability model from
   status/news fields.
4. Optimise XI, waivers, trade suggestions vs the 5 rivals' actual squads.
5. Write data/predictions.json; the static site reads it client-side.

## Needed from Justin
- Numeric draft league ID (in the URL at draft.premierleague.com once in the league)
- GitHub repo created with Actions enabled; push this scaffold
